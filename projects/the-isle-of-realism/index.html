                <p>
                    The Isle of Realism is a game in which showcases weather patterns, seasons and a realistic island. The purpose of this game/experiecne is to 
                    give awareness of the different dangers during the different weather events and what do to in that scenerio. The game will provide up to date instructions, 
                    warnings and explainations for the different seasons and weather events. The weather and seasons dynamically change 
                    over time. Seasons will show the season that the player is currently in, for example if its December the game will render the game to the season winter.
                    The weather patterns will also be linked to the season - autumn will have a higher chance of storms and winter will be the only time when it will snow 
                    in the game.

                    The game would render a map with the season that the players actual playing season is. Below is 3 images showing Summer, Autumn and Winter - the reason 
                    why Spring is not shown is because it will visually look like Autumn however with no leaves on the ground and more trees without leaves. Seasons will not 
                    change/transition when a person playing the game goes from another season to another in real life; they will have to rejoin if they want it to be updated.

                    The game will include a detailed weather pattern system which will be directly linked to the seasons. The weather system will have the following forcasted;
                    Sunny, Foggy, Cloudy, Rain, Heavy Rain, Partly Cloudy, Showers, Sleet, Snow, Windy, Storm, Hurricane and way more! Seasons will have an impact whether or not 
                    a certain weather type will happen or not. For example in the Summer season it will be very unlikely for it to snow and instead we can increase the likelyhood
                    of sunny weather. The weather system will be random in most cases with some exceptions like the type of season and other events that do not happen randomly. Below is a 
                    full list of all the weather events which can occur in the game:
