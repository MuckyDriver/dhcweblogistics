                            <span> NukeLab is a game I made in 2018 where you click on a button (red one!) to set off a missile down to a island called Craiz.
                            Players are capable of respawning the map and the missle as many times as they want. As a bonus you can gain points (maybe) when you escape 
                            the explosion.</span>

                            <span>Planetary Object Realm was a project I created which gives a showcase of our solar system and their planets including a space ship
                            which is completely fiction. I was planning to make the spaceship fly past the planets and explaining them all for a college project 
                            but i never got to it and now its considered a dead project. Before I closed the game it was possible to fly around with controls where you can
                            go up and down and forwards and backwards at different speeds.</span>

                            <span>In 2021 I decided to create a working copy of Stickmasterluke's Jail break game. I added new lighting effects and a new crawling function to give it the feel
                                it had years ago on the original game. I even added two options to finish the game; pc users can crawl to the finish, mobile users can walk on a longer path to the

                                In doing so you go past the "null" zone which is known since data starts to break apart and your player flickers and the camera stops working

                            <span>Bridge obby was an obby which I created where you had to cross a falling down bridge with multiple checkpoints until you get to the end. 
                                I state in my game page how the bridge is like 100 years old and it will need to be replaced very soon. 
                                For some other reason apparently there is a war going on and that is the main reason why the player needs to cross the bridge. 
                                It had quite a lot of attraction however since the game was broken it recieved a lot of dislikes so it's not on of my favourited game creation.
