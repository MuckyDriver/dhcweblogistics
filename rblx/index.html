                            <span> NukeLab is a game I made in 2018 where you click on a button (red one!) to set off a missile down to a island called Craiz.
                            Players are capable of respawning the map and the missle as many times as they want. As a bonus you can gain points (maybe) when you escape 
                            the explosion.</span>

                            <span>Planetary Object Realm was a project I created which gives a showcase of our solar system and their planets including a space ship
                            which is completely fiction. I was planning to make the spaceship fly past the planets and explaining them all for a college project 
                            but i never got to it and now its considered a dead project. Before I closed the game it was possible to fly around with controls where you can
                            go up and down and forwards and backwards at different speeds.</span>

                            <span>In 2021 I decided to create a working copy of Stickmasterluke's Jail break game. I added new lighting effects and a new crawling function to give it the feel
                                it had years ago on the original game. I even added two options to finish the game; pc users can crawl to the finish, mobile users can walk on a longer path to the
