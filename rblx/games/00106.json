    "description": "Bridge obby was an obby which I created where you had to cross a falling down bridge with multiple checkpoints until you get to the end. I state in my game page how the bridge is like 100 years old and it will need to be replaced very soon. For some other reason apparently there is a war going on and that is the main reason why the player needs to cross the bridge. It had quite a lot of attraction however since the game was broken it recieved a lot of dislikes so it's not on of my favourited game creation.",
