    "description": "In 2021 I decided to create a working copy of Stickmasterluke's Jail break game. I added new lighting effects and a new crawling function to give it the feel it had years ago on the original game. I even added two options to finish the game; pc users can crawl to the finish, mobile users can walk on a longer path to the finish instead.",
