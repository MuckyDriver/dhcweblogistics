    "description": "Planetary Object Realm was a project I created which gives a showcase of our solar system and their planets including a space ship which is completely fiction. I was planning to make the spaceship fly past the planets and explaining them all for a college project but i never got to it and now its considered a dead project. Before I closed the game it was possible to fly around with controls where you can go up and down and forwards and backwards at different speeds.",
