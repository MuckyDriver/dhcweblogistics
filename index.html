                    The place where the best designed websites out there! <br>
                    In this website I will give information on how you can order a website! At this moment in time I am doing this for training purposes and I do only have
                    limited experience using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

                    <span class="u">My Skill Level:</span><br><br>
                    My current skill level in developing website designs and code. <br>
                    I would say I have an intermediate amount of experience of using <span>HTML and CSS</span> and very familiar with the basics. <br>
                    I have a small amount of experience in <span>JavaScript</span>, understanding basic functions, variables and more. <br>
                    As well as JavaScript I have touched on <span>React</span> to give it a go and how it felt, I must say I do understand it a little but I have not
                    put lots of time into it.

                    <span class="u">Pricing:</span><br><br>
                    <span>Current Price:</span> Â£16.00 p/pg (per page)<br>
                    <span>Details:</span> All Commissions may have additional fees depending what services the client chooses to have. 
                    As this is mainly focusing for educational purposes / training purposes the prices are calculated from how many pages are being made.
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Static or Dynamic?</span><br>Static Pages, at this moment in time I do not have enough knowledge on dynamic webpages. However, I am looking into learning more
                    about them; so in the future I can make them for people to order.

                        <span>Website Types:</span><br>I am up to making any type of website as long as it works within a static website. Some types of websites could be informative, awareness,
                        poster, leaflet, about you, about your company, advertisement or a portfolio. Anything like that would be fine to me :D!
