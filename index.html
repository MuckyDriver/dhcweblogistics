                    <p>Currently, my skills go around an intermediate amount of knowledge in HTML and CSS. I have a basic understanding of JavaScript including; Functions, Ids, 
                    Variables, Constants, Responsive web designing and more! To discover more about my skills visit my <a link-a href="gallery.html">gallery</a>!</p>

                <div><span dhc-heading>Website Details</span>
                   <p>
                       <span dhc-subheading>Dynamic or Static?</span><br>
                       All the websites I make will only be in static form, anything like information pages, posters, tutorials, advertisments are fine for me to make as long as it does not includes
                       any dynamic part of the website. In the near future I hope to be able to make dynamic pages using SQL, PHP and more!<br><br>
                       <span dhc-subheading>Payments</span><br>
                       After your quote is successful and you accept it, I will then start making the website from what designs you wanted the website to have. I will be calculating the price from how much hours of work
                       I have put into the websites. Payment will be <b>only</b> accepted via PayPal!<br><br>
                       <span dhc-subheading>How long does it take?</span><br>
                       This all depends on how much you want to me created; the amount of pages and the amount of designs you want to add on each page. A 16 page website will take from 1-2 weeks depending on my
                       schedule from other projects going at the same time. If the website you quoted does not get finished by <b>2 weeks</b> then I will respond to you either with the current build or ask you 
                       for a extra week to get it done.

                    <p>Depending on your needs and what you want the website to be, you need to decide on what plan it will categorize in. If you are going for a website with no more than 1 page
                    the "Single Page" plan would work for you! If your needs goes above 1 page then the cheapest option for you would be the "Standard" plan which can have up to 16 pages.</p>
