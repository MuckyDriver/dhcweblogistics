                The website is still being made to this day with more information added. Likely the finishing date would be 2022!

                It is very likely this website will never be implemented into a REACT.js website since the website does not fit the criteria.<br>
                Even though anykind of website can be used with REACT.js our opinions are different and the website should stay on plain old basic html and css until further notice.
