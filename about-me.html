                                Hello, my username is Claasgreeneye also sometimes known as DHCGamer1055. 
                                I am person with superior imagination which allows me to be associated with website and game development projects.
                                Currently I am studying a course at college about everything to do with computing. The achievement of passing the college course would allow me
                                to move on and gain the necessary knowledge for a job that fits my interests. I do see myself as some sort of Innovator even though at the current time
                                I have not invented anything - in the future this could be a different story. 
                                <br><br>
                                At the moment I am working on this website to include all of my past and current projects. 
                                This website has the sole purpose of acting as a portfolio site where my skills can be presented.

                            </div><br>
                            My past in the world of game development and website development is limited. It was only 4 years ago or around that when I started designing my first
                            Roblox game. Even though I did make games on Roblox in 2017 they were made without any scripting, no original models and mainly small as I had no
                            experience on how to make Roblox games back then. In 2019 I found myself interested in learning the language to create games on Roblox which is Luau. 
                            The exact game I was working on is unknown as I have changed the original files with something else. During Mid 2018 I created my first fully created game
                            NukeLab which is a game all about nuking a small island and see the destruction of the buildings etc. Early 2019; I developed a game called "Ultimate Sad Su Tart Story", which
                            was created during a trend. To this day this game is the most successful games that I have created. 
                            <br><br>
                            Late 2019 marked the year I started the longest Roblox project - named Mucky Driver! This game is all about players driving cars around a map and 
                            collecting points to upgrade to a new vehicle. The original name for this game was to be "Offroader Sim 19" however at the time Roblox moderation
                            decided that was not allowed and that is how I thought of "Mucky Driver" instead. Mucky Driver includes a vast map, ten plus vehicles and challenges you can do.
                            However, early 2023 I decided the project is taking to long and the inspiration behind the game was thin so the project was discontinued. The Mucky Driver project 
                            has given me new skills and knowledge on how to create a Roblox game and has provided me experience on what to do and not what to do when developing a Roblox game.

                            </div><br>
                            I started to learn how to do website development on a basic level back in 2019 before going to college as I predicted I will need such skills. Even 
                            though in that course i did not require the knowledge on HTML, CSS etc the act of doing so opened a big interest route for me to go along with. Website
                            development uses my imagination skills and allows me to create things and design. For the past 4 years the interest in website design has not changed -
                            which is a good thing and a bad one because; I have not exactly explored into CSS/JS frameworks and creating dynamic webpages, but this I feel this is going to change very
                            soon.
