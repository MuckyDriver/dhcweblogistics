    "description": "Coming soon as part of a project. Drive is a game where you can drive around a massive simplistic fictional map. The map is still in the works and will be expanded much more than it is now. In the future I hope to finish this little project by mid-2023 with enough features to keep people going. The purpose of this game is to test how big you can create a game and how fun it would be for someone to play it.",
